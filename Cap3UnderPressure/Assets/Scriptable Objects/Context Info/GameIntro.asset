    text: It's weird to think that society used to live above ground where things
      like trees grew and animals prospered with humans.
  - panel: {fileID: 0}
    text: I never really knew what that was like since I was born into the Underground
      Society.

    text: The closest experience I've ever had with such luxury was through the books
      and videos they gave us to study.
  - panel: {fileID: 0}
    text: Any reason to learn these things was only for the benefit of keeping track
      of our previous history above ground - even if there's not much benefit for
      knowing.

    text: We can't even grow any plant life here or even raise animals. Any other
      non-human being that required our oxygen was just seen as a waste of society's
      space.
  - panel: {fileID: 0}
    text: Hence, only certain animals exist like cows. Yet, even they're a luxury
      now. People like us just rely on rations while the big heads in the government
      eat things like burgers.

      that luxury."

    text: I hope my aptitude test results put me somewhere good. I've studied hard
      to get here, I don't plan to fail.
